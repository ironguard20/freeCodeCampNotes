I started this process during the Applied Visual Design section of the FCC beta. Therefore I will have to go back at somepoint to take notes pertinent to information covered before this point. For now, I'll continue on.

AVD: Change an Elements Relative Position:

CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}
Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.

Note
Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

<AVD:  Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets>
The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. This can be slightly confusing, because you're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which effectively moves it towards the opposite direction. As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset effectively moves an item to the right.

<AVD: Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning>
The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

<AVD:  Learn about Tertiary Colors >
Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange. This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:

Color	Hex Code
orange	#FF7D00
cyan	#00FFFF
raspberry	#FF007D

< AVD: Adjust the Hue of a Color >
Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.

Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

Color	HSL
red	hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
yellow	hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
green	hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
cyan	hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue	hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta	hsl(300, 100%, 50%)

< AVD: Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient >
Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:

background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a vertical gradient and 45deg is angled like a backslash. The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

Example:

background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

<AVD: Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element >

The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.

The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.

In the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels away from the beginning of the gradient.

For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.

0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px

If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.

< AVD: Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element >

To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:

p {
  transform:scale(2);
}

< AVD: Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover >

The transform property has a variety of functions that lets you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:

p:hover {
  transform: scale(2.1);
}

< AVD: Create a Graphic Using CSS >

By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.

In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.

You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

< AVD: Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work >

To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:

#anim {
  animation-name: colorful;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
@keyframes colorful {
  0% {
   background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.

< AVD: Use CSS Animation to Change the Hover State of a Button >

You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

Here's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:

<style>
  img:hover {
    animation-name: width;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
  }

  @keyframes width {
    100% {
      width: 40px;
    }
  }
</style>

<img src="https://bit.ly/smallgooglelogo" alt="Google's Logo" />

Note that ms stands for milliseconds, where 1000ms is equal to 1s.

< AVD: Modify Fill Mode of an Animation >

That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.

This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:

animation-fill-mode: forwards;

< AVD: Create Movement Using CSS Animation >

When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.

As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the 50% keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.

@keyframes rainbow {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
    top: 0px;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: green;
    top: 50px;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
    top: 0px;
  }
}

< AVD: Create Visual Direction by Fading an Element from Left to Right >

For this challenge, you'll change the opacity of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the @keyframes rule.

< AVD: Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count >

The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

animation-iteration-count: 3;

In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.

< AVD: Make a CSS Heartbeat using an Infinite Animation Count >

Here's one more continuous animation example with the animation-iteration-count property that uses the heart you designed in a previous challenge.

The one-second long heartbeat animation consists of two animated pieces. The heart elements (including the :before and :after pieces) are animated to change size using the transform property, and the background div is animated to change its color using the background property.

< AVD: Animate Elements at Variable Rates >

There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. So far, this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two "stars" that each decrease in size and opacity at the 20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements so the stars twinkle at different rates.

< AVD: Animate Multiple Elements at Variable Rates >

In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

In the animation running in the code editor, there are three "stars" in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different values for each element.

< AVD: Change Animation Timing with Keywords >

In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, or ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end.

<AVD: Learn How Bezier Curves Work >

The last challenge introduced the animation-timing-function property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.

In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.

The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0 and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);

In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.

< AVD: Use a Bezier Curve to Move a Graphic >

A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:

animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);

Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) then it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.

< AVD: Make Motion More Natural Using a Bezier Curve >

This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize a Bezier curve for this.

The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);

Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on an 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.
